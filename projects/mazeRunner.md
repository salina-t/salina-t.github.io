Maze Runner is a role-playing game that I created as a solo project in my high school AP Computer Science A course (2022). The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive game using
Java.

This project helped me develop strong skills in concepts such as polymorphism, inheritance, reading/writing files, and mapping values to create a playable game map.  

Maze Runner implements a variety of classes to represent different character types, maps, and boosts with corresponding functions according to their class. 
This game also explores the concept of mapping values from a text file to create a playable board for users. 

Here is a sample of what Maze Runner looks like:
