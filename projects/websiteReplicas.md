## Daily Whisk Website Replica

At the time of this project, I was learning web development and design. I also discovered my liking to matcha, so to practice my skills, I created a replica of the Daily Whisk website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and React. The website features a homepage, menu, about us, and contact us page. The website is designed to be visually appealing and a template for a real website--as I was just practcing creating visual designs and layouts and not the actual content.

## Buzz's Original Steak House Website Replica

I was assigned to create a replica of the Buzz's Original Steak House website when I was taking my Software development course (ICS 314). This time, I created this website replica with pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Similarly to the Daily Whisk replica, this website was designed to exercise my skills in web development and help me get a better understanding of how to create visually appealing websites.
