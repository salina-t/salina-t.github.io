## Preparation

Much like many of my classmates, I felt a sense of anxiety as I prepared for my first WOD (Workout of the Day).
Although I consider myself a proficient programmer, the unfamiliarity of the situation left me feeling uneasy.
In preparation, I reviewed the exercises from freeCodeCamp, assuming they would be similar to the WOD. 
I deduced that the WOD would be more of a beginner-level prompt since it was our first exercise, and we had just completed  
a module introducing the class to Javascript. Knowing that it would likely be a beginner-level exercise reduced my
nervousness, but I didn't want to underestimate the situation, so I prepared myself for any challenge that might
come my way.

## Expectations vs Reality

As soon as the timer started, I felt myself lock in a state of deep focus. The WOD prompt wasn't nearly as challenging
as I convinced myself it would be. To my amazement, I completed the WOD in less than 5 minutes, and felt a sense of  
relief wash over me as I submitted it. 

As I reflected on my expectations versus my reality of the situation, I'm grateful for the preparation I engaged in for 
the WOD, though I wish I had approached it with a more confident and optimistic mindset. Whilst waiting for my classmates
to complete the task, it became clear to me the most challenging part of the situation wasn't the prompt or the task 
itself, but rather the excessive self-doubt that had built up in me.

This was a really eye-opening experience. I realized that even though some things are out of my comfort zone
doesn't mean I lack the capability to achieve it. The perfect balance of confidence and humility can fuel a strong 
determination to accomplish tasks without undermining their gravity or generating unnecessary anxiety. 

## Technical Analysis

Due to my nervousness, I opted for the simplest approach to implementing the assigned task. The method I used to write 
the function was highly specific to the task and lacked versatility. However, I believe I did this in fear of potential
point deductions for straying from the prompt. 

Looking back, I think I would've chosen a different and more adaptable approach to create a function that would have
been more universally functional. At the time, I believed that introducing parameters and similar modifications might 
cause me to lose points, so I refrained from experimenting creatively and instead went with a simpler path.

## After the Storm

Once the WOD had concluded, our class engaged in a discussion that made me appreciate the different perspectives to
the same prompt. So far, these class discussions have proven to be really helpful as they offer a range of approaches to
tackling the same prompt, which in turn, inspires me to code with more clarity and practicality. Though I feel like I
missed an opportunity to write a better function for my first WOD, I feel motivated to do better in the next WOD.
Overall, I believe these class discussions are advantageous not only for me but also for many of my classmates,
motivating them to become better programmers as well. 

In summary, my first WOD experience has been a great learning opportunity. In the future WODs, I aim to approach new tasks 
with greater confidence and willingness to write more adaptable and practical code. I hope to see my own growth and 
improvement as a programmer in the upcoming WODs.
