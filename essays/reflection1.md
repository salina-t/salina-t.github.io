I was first introduced to Javascript in my “Introduction to Computer Science” class in my Junior year of high school, so I was relatively familiar with the programming language coming into this course. Since the class that I took was an introduction class, I learned and explored the basics of Javascript. Ever since then, I haven’t been coding in Javascript very often, so my knowledge of this language was not as strong. However, completing the freeCodeCamp exercises was really helpful to refresh my memory and learn new tools and techniques I could use in the future. Completing those exercises helped me recognize the extended functionality and tools that Javascript offers to its users. 

Javascript is very similar to Java. Since I am most familiar with Java, the similarity gave me reassurance while completing the freeCodeCamp exercises and WODs. Both languages have similar syntax styles and are widely used in front-end development. Despite their similarities, they also have their differences that make them unique. For example, Java is a programming language that utilizes a virtual machine to help compile programs, giving the language a lot of flexibility to be run on any platform or operating system. On the other hand, Javascript is a scripting programming language that utilizes a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to make Javascript code executable. 

Overall, Javascript is a useful and flexible programming language. Javascript allows its users a lot of versatility in subjects such as object-oriented programming and web development, which allows many opportunities to be developed using Javascript. In addition to Javascript’s versatility, it is also very efficient in terms of speed, memory, and therefore performance. This strength in performance makes it very popular in front-end development, as well as the fact that it is executed using a JIT compiler, which makes Javascript code universal and ubiquitous. Javascript also supports asynchronous programming, which enables programs to run multiple operations at the same time, without blocking execution of other code. This, in turn, makes Javascript very fast and efficient. As well as being a powerful language, Javascript is also very user-friendly, which makes it a welcoming language to beginner programmers. 

As I was completing the freeCodeCamp modules, I found that the exercises under the ES6 module were more challenging than the Javascript basics, but I was still able to complete them. I think the part I had the most trouble with was the destructuring exercises, but I decided to redo them later so I could get a stronger understanding of them. ES6 is a very minimalistic language that allows users to write clean and concise code. This can be both an advantage and disadvantage as it may make code more readable but may be confusing to new users, or difficult to trace. 

Athletic software engineering is a great practice to optimize speed and mentality in programmers. This style of learning may be stressful because of unknown prompts and scenarios, however, it reflects real-life situations where programmers will face bugs and challenges with no warning. Getting into the habit of practicing athletic software engineering will benefit programmers by encouraging them to look at problems in a sharp way, to complete them efficiently and in a timely manner. Additionally, at the end of the exercises, programmers will tend to feel accomplished and proud of themselves, making the activities enjoyable. 

Speaking from experience, I find myself overthinking the WODs way more than I need to. I am afraid of not being able to solve the problems but I think it is natural to feel anxious about something that is unknown. With more and more practice with the WODs, I gained a sense of confidence and determination to complete them proficiently and punctually. Although it might be every student’s least favorite way of testing their skills and knowledge, I think we all internally know that it is for our own benefit.
