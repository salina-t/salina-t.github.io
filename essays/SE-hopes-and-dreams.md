## The Spark

After exploring the world of computer science through creating silly apps and simple games using Javascript and Java, 
I fell in love with the endless possibilities that programming offers. Driven by my
intense curiosity to learn more, I decided to take AP Computer Science A, where that passion grew more and more as time 
went by. I knew that I enjoyed programming, and it was something that I wanted to pursue further.

## The Journey so Far 

As exciting as programming has been, it has not been an easy journey. There were many concepts that frustrated me, yet 
made me feel so accomplished when I figured it out. I still face new challenges present day, but what challenges me encourages
me to improve myself and become a stronger programmer and learner. The feeling of understanding why everything works the way that it works 
is an unmatching reward.

A beautiful fact about computer science is that there are always new things to learn. In the world of programming, there are
so many tools that are available to users to create anything and everything they want to achieve. The past ICS courses I have 
taken (ICS 211: Introduction to Computer Science II and ICS 212: Programming Structures) have helped me find my passions in 
computer science and figure out what specialized area I would like to purse.

## My Ambitions for the Future

In the future, I hope to find my place in computer science in software engineering, information systems, or
web/application development. I admire the versatility and responsibility that come with the development process 
of creating projects, and would greatly appreciate being able to spend my days practicing something I love as 
my career. I love designing, creating, and learning, so I hope to find a career that allows me to practice these skills.

I recognize that I still have many new things to learn before I can reach my end goal, but as I continue my studies 
at university, I hope to strengthen my technical skills and develop as a person to be trusted with the responsibility
of creating large projects for businesses and clients. I hope to gain experience through internships to prepare myself 
to reach beyond the standards when graduating from college and setting foot into the work industry.
